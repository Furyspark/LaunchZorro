## Usage
Step 1) Set up a basic folder structure in the root directory of LaunchZorro. You can see an example in the profiles folder of this project.
Step 2) Create profiles with the Profile Creator and save them in the category type folders in the folder structure (i.e. RPG or FPS in the sample folder structure)
Step 3) Launch LaunchZorro, select devices on the left (if not using normal), select a category to the right, and then select a profile more to the right.
Step 4) Your profile should now be active. Press F1 to suspend/resume the profile (you should hear a sound). If it doesn't work, make sure the Interception driver is successfully installed before opening LaunchZorro.
